# Variability of functional and biodiversity responses

Code (R markdown and Jupyter notebook) used for the synthesis, simulations and figures in the paper: "Variability of functional and biodiversity responses to perturbations is predictable and informative" by James A. Orr, Jeremy J. Piggott, Andrew L. Jackson, Michelle C. Jackson and Jean-Francois Arnoldi.

The folder "1. empirical motivation" contains an R markdown used to conduct the initial analysis of the Zhou dataset, which is available as a csv file. The outputs datasets from this file are stored in the folder "output".

The folder "2. simulations" contains a Jupyter notebook used to carry out numerical simulations and to create the relevant figures in the paper. The empirical data collected and organised during the synthesis is available in the sub folder "data". 

The folder "3. empirical reanalysis" contains a Jupyter notebook used to carry out the reanalysis of the empirical dataset that was informed by our geometric framework.
