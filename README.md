# Observation of Stressor Interactions

Code (R markdown and Jupyter notebook) used for the synthesis, simulations and figures in the paper: "Stressor interactions at the community level: explaining qualitative mismatches between observations" by James A. Orr, Jeremy J. Piggott, Andrew L. Jackson, Michelle C. Jackson and Jean-Francois Arnoldi.

The folder "empirical" contains an R markdown used to conduct a synthesis of two databases which are available in the sub folder "data". 

The folder "simulations" contains a Jupyter notebook used to carry out numerical simulations and to create the figures in the paper. The empirical data collected and organised during the synthesis is available in the sub folder "data".
