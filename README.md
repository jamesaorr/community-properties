# Variability of functional and biodiversity responses

Code (R markdown and Jupyter notebook) used for the synthesis, simulations and figures in the paper: "Variability of functional and biodiversity responses to perturbations is predictable and informative" by James A. Orr, Jeremy J. Piggott, Andrew L. Jackson, Michelle C. Jackson and Jean-Francois Arnoldi.

The folder "synthesis" contains an R markdown used to conduct a synthesis of the Zhou dataset, which is available as a csv file. 

The folder "simulations" contains a Jupyter notebook used to carry out numerical simulations and to create the figures in the paper. The empirical data collected and organised during the synthesis is available in the sub folder "data".
